"""Task queue logic.

Create a context for scheduling tasks upon exiting the context.

Initially was designed for `with_task_queue` decorator. It creates task queue
upon entering the API action and keeps track of ownership transfer tasks
produced by validators. If all validators succesfully passed and decorated
action finished, tasks are executed, moving file ownership to the
created/updated entity.

It's a high-level module that relies on base and utils.
